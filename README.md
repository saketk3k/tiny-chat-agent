# Tiny Chat Agent

A lightweight, interactive chat agent built with **Streamlit**.

## Purpose
This POC demonstrates how to build a stateful Conversational UI in pure Python, which is a common requirement for internal AI tools.

## Features
-   **Chat Interface**: Uses Streamlit's native `st.chat_message` components.
-   **State Management**: Persists chat history across re-runs.
-   **Tool Routing**: Simple keyword detection simulates "Agentic" behavior (choosing which tool to run based on input).
